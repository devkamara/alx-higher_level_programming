## 0x00. Python - Hello, World

##### For this project, I look at this concept:

###### Python programming. I get to read about Python, get to know it's creators, 
###### where the name Python came from,
###### the Zen of Python, 
###### how to install it on Windows and the command prompt, as well as on Ubuntu for Windows, 
###### how to print text and variables using print, 
###### how to use strings, 
###### and the Python coding style.
